# Counting-Program-Cpp
This C++ program prints counting numbers from 1 to a given number (n) using a user-defined function. The program takes input from the user and passes it to a function that handles the counting logic. Inside the function, a for loop is used to iterate from 1 to n, printing each number sequentially.
